# Has Twitter Fixed Replies Yet?

Back in 2009, Twitter [changed the way replies were handled](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2009/the-replies-kerfuffle.html). Many people were miffed by this change and felt that the @reply functionality was permanently borked. This project will continue to beat a subjectively dead horse until Twitter figures out how people actually use their service.

You’re welcome.
