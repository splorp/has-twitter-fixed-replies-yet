# Has Twitter Fixed Replies Yet?

Back in 2009, Twitter [changed the way replies were handled](http://blog.twitter.com/2009/05/replies-kerfuffle.html). Many people were miffed by this change and felt that the @reply functionality has been borked ever since. This site continues to beat a subjectively dead horse.

You’re welcome.
